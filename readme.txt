I have a small experience with front end frameworks (such angularJS)
but I have a lot experience with UI libraries (particularly kendo UI)
so I decided to use ready solutions from Kendo UI and its directives for angularJS.

My realization of this task took 2 hours.
It was not fully realized because i have a nice skills oriented for visualisation UI/UX and my functionality skills are small.

I am with big pleasure and very quickly do tasks for visual part of front-end (templates and animations for UI/UX),
but for functional part unfortunately i need more practice.
